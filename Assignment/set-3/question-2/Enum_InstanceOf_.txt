Q2) Can we create an instance of Enum outside of Enum itself?
Explain your answer.


Answer--> InstanceOf==The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison
operator because it compares the instance with type. 
It returns either true or false.

No, you can not create enum instances outside of the 
Enum boundary, because Enum doesn't have any public 
constructor, and the compiler doesn't allow you to 
provide any public constructor in Enum.

Both expression gives you String object, but there is subtle difference between them.
When you use new String( "Hello World!!" ); , it explicitly creates a new and referentially
distinct instance of a String object. It is an individual instance of the java.lang.String
class. String s="Hello World!!"; may reuse an instance from the string constant pool if one
is available (String Pool is a pool of Strings stored in Java heap memory ).

Example:-

String str1 = "Hello World!!";
String str2 = "Hello World!!";
System.out.println(str1 == str2);  // true

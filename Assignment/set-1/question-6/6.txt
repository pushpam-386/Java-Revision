ClassCast Exception in Java is one of the unchecked exceptions that occur when we try to
convert one class type object into another class type.

ClassCast Exception is thrown when we try to cast an object of the parent class to 
the child class object. However, it can also be thrown when we try to convert the objects
of two individual classes that don't have any relationship between them.

Consider the following example, in which we have shown how the ClassCast Exception is thrown.


public class Animal {  
String color;  
Animal(String color){  
this.color = color;  
}  
void eat(String name) {  
System.out.println(name + " is eating .....");  
}  
void show(String name) {  
System.out.println(name + " is of " + color + " Color");  
}  
}  
public class Dog extends Animal{  
Dog(String color) {  
super(color);  
}  
void eat(String name) {  
System.out.println(name + " is eating ....");  
}  
}  
  
public class Main {  
public static void main(String[] args) {   
Dog dog = new Dog("black");  
Animal animal = new Animal("White");  
animal = dog;  
animal.show("My dog");  
  
Animal animal1 = new Animal("White");  
Dog d = (Dog)animal1;  
}  
}

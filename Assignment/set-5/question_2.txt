An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.
However, the limitation of the array is that the size of the array is predefined and fixed.

ArrayList is a part of the collection framework. It is present in the java.util package
and provides us dynamic arrays in Java. Though, it may be slower than standard arrays
but can be helpful in programs where lots of manipulation in the array is needed.
We can dynamically add and remove items. It automatically resizes itself.
